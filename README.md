# Why?

Because I saw many examples, all of which claim to be "minimum viable projects" but are in fact pretty big,
with most things already set up.
I made a very small one, so that everything else (except dynamic chunk navigation) is up to you. I started from
[react-dynamic-route-loading-es6](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/react-dynamic-route-loading-es6), kudos to the original repo.

## Prerequisite Technologies
### Linux
* *node.js*
* *npm*
* *eslint* - if you use Atom install `linter-eslint` package
* *git*


## Installation
To download dependencies run `npm i` from the project root.
Once the command is finished, you can run the following CLI commands from the project root:

```

$ npm start
* run a local server on port 8080 serving /dist directory (no bundle created)

$ npm run build
* compile  (bundle created)
